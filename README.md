# Office-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

I made an easy to use command line office team maker. I wanted to organize and have basic info for each employee on a generated html page. It displays an employees name, role, email and specific things for the role such as github username or school the intern came from. I use tests to make sure my code works for each employee and have scripts for each card to be displayed on page. I learned a lot about how tests work and how to build them. I learned a lot about how to use code from seperate files in a seperate file and a lot about OOP and TDD.
